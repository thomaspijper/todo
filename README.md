# ToDo

ToDo is a simple command-line based task manager. Although created as an programming exercise for learning Rust, it is intended to be very usable.

## Description

ToDo allows one to create tasks, set due dates, add notes, and label and categorize tasks by color. It is operated from a terminal.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

ToDo is OS agnostic, so it should run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Perhaps also on BSD. 

### Installing

Right now, installing is simply a matter of downloading the repo and running `cargo build --release`. Then, put the executable in a directory where you have read/write permissing and add it to your shells's path.

### Executing program

Run the program with `todo [command] [arguments]`. The following commands are (soon to be) implemented:

* `todo add [task name]` adds a task with name `task name`. Spaces in the name are allowed. Returned is the task's ID (needed for all further operations on this task).
* `todo due [task_id] [due_date]` sets the due date for the task with ID `task_id`. The required format for `due_date` is YYYY-MM-DD.
* `todo note [task_id] [text]` sets a note or description for the task with ID `task_id`. All arguments after the ID are taken as the note. If a note already exists, `text` is added to it. If `text` equals `clear`, the note is removed
* `todo color [task_id] [color]` sets a color for the task with ID `task_id`. Colors can be used to group and order tasks. Available colors are `red`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, and `purple`. Specifying `clear` removes the color.
* `todo due [task_id] [task name]` renames the task with ID `task_id` to `task name`.
* `todo remove [task_id]` removes the task with ID `task_id`.
* `todo list` lists all tasks.
* `todo show [task_id]` shows details for the task with ID `task_id`.
* `todo sort` groups tasks by color and sorts them by colors of the rainbow (red -> purple). Within each group, tasks are sorted by due date. This operations changes the IDs of the tasks
* `todo undo` undoes the latest change to tasks. Only one undo is available.
* `todo help` displays how this program can be used.

## Data location
Data is saved in the userâ€™s data directory (e.g. `%APPDATA%\Roaming` on Windows). 

## Caveat emptor

This is a project that I started to learn Rust. Everyone is free to use it, but I can provide no guarantee that it works as intended. As such, I cannot be held responsible for unintended data loss nor for any other ill effects such as your computer catching fire.
